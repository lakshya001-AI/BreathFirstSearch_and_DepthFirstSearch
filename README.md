## Introduction

### What are BFS and DFS?

Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are two of the most fundamental graph traversal algorithms used in computer science. They are used to explore and search through graph-like data structures. These algorithms help us answer questions like:

- Is there a path from node A to node B?
- What is the shortest path between two nodes?
- Are there any cycles in the graph?
- Can we reach all nodes from a given starting node?
